翠竹影下，年轻的比丘缚悉底跏趺而坐，全神专注于呼吸，不知不觉，一个多小时过去了。其他四百多位习禅者和缚悉底一样，在伟大导师乔达摩的指导下，在竹林中或茅棚里各自习禅，人人都亲切地呼唤他们的导师为“佛陀”。

这片竹林，方圆四十亩。七年前，波斯匿王将之赠送给佛陀和他的僧团，从此被称为竹林精舍。从王舍城向北行，只需三十分钟便可到达这里。寺院四围种满了来自摩揭陀国的不同品种的翠竹，环境十分清静幽雅。


Under the shadows of the green bamboo, the young bhikkhu, Svasti, sat cross-legged, concentrating on his breath. He had been meditating for more than anhour in the Bamboo Forest Monastery, while hundreds of other bhikkhus were also practicing under the shade of the bamboo trees or in their own thatched huts.

The great teacher Gautama, whom people affectionately called the “Buddha,” lived in the monastery with nearly four hundred disciples. Although crowded, it was very peaceful. Forty acres surrounded the monastery, and many varieties of graceful  bamboo  from  all  over  Magadha  were  planted  there. Just a thirty minutes’ walk  north of the capital city of Rajagaha, the Bamboo Forest Monastery had been given to Buddha and his  community by King Bimbisara seven years earlier.

揉揉眼睛，缚悉底展颜微笑，当他慢慢地放开腿来，双脚仍是酸麻麻的。今年二十一岁的他，刚在三天前受了比丘戒。戒仪由佛陀的十大弟子之一的舍利弗主持。受戒的仪式当中，缚悉底一头咖啡色的头发被全部剃掉。缚悉底十分庆幸自己可以成为佛陀僧团的一分子。很多比丘都是来自贵族阶层，就像佛陀的弟弟难陀尊者、提婆达多、阿那律和阿难陀等。无须别人正式介绍，缚悉底从远处已经可以辨认出他们来。虽然他们的衲衣破旧褪色，但他们的气质仍十分高雅。

Svasti rubbed his eyes and smiled. His legs were still tender as he slowly uncrossed them. Twenty-one years old, he had been ordained three days earlier by the Venerable Sariputta, one of the Buddha’s senior disciples. During the ordination ceremony, Svasti’s thick brown hair was shaved off.

Svasti  was  very  happy  to  be  part  of  the  Buddha’s  community.  Many  bhikkhus were  of  noble  birth,  such  as  the  Venerable  Nanda,  the  Buddha’s  brother,  and Devadatta,  Anuruddha,  and  Ananda.  Although  Svasti  had  not  yet  been introduced  to  these  men,  he  had  noticed  them  from  afar.  Even  in  faded  robes, their noble bearing was unmistakable.

“大概还要过一段日子，我才可以和这些贵族背景的比丘们结交吧。”缚悉底想。

奇怪的是，虽然佛陀也是王者之子，缚悉底却一点也不觉得与他有隔膜。缚悉底属于所谓的“不可接触者”，因他出生自最底层、最贫贱的阶级。这是当时印度阶级体制所导致的歧视。十年以来，他都是以放水牛为生。但这两星期，他可以和其他来自不同背景的出家人一起修行。每个人都对他很好，给他和蔼的笑容和深深的鞠躬。可是他仍觉得很不自在。他相信大概要几年时间，他才可以全面适应和感到舒泰。

“It will be a long time before I can be friends with men of such noble birth,” thought Svasti. And yet, even though the Buddha himself was the son of a king, Svasti  felt  no  gulf  between  them.  Svasti  was  an  “untouchable,”  lower  than  the lowest  and  poorest  caste  according  to  the  system  of  discrimination  among  the people  of  India  at  that  time.  For  more  than  ten  years,  he  had  tended  water
buffalo, but for two weeks now, he was living and practicing with monks from
all castes. Everyone was very kind to him, offering him warm smiles and deep
bows, but he did not yet feel at ease. He suspected it might take years before he
could feel completely comfortable.


忽然，他从心底里涌出了欢颜，因他这一刻想起佛陀的十八岁的儿子罗睺罗。从十岁开始，罗睺罗已是僧团里的一个沙弥。在这短短的两星期中，他们两人已成了最要好的朋友。虽然罗睺罗仍未成为正式比丘，但却是他教缚悉底怎样随着呼吸坐禅的。虽然罗睺罗未受比丘戒，但他对佛陀的教导已有很深的认识。只要等到满二十岁，他便可以受具足戒，成为正式比丘。

Suddenly,  a  broad  smile  emerged  from  deep  within  him,  as  he  thought  of
Rahula,  the  Buddha’s  eighteen-year-old  son.  Rahula  had  been  a  novice  in  the
community  since  the  age  of  ten,  and  in  just  two  weeks  Rahula  and  Svasti  had
become best friends. It was Rahula who taught Svasti how to follow his breath
during meditation. Rahula understood the Buddha’s teachings well, even though
he was not yet a bhikkhu. He needed to wait until he was twenty before he could
receive full ordination.

缚悉底回想起两星期前，佛陀来到伽耶附近的小村落优楼频螺，邀请他出家的情形。当佛陀来到他的家里时，缚悉底正和他的弟弟卢培克在外面放水牛，家中只剩下两个妹妹，十六岁的芭娜和十二岁的媲摩。芭娜一望便认出来访者是佛陀。正当她想赶快跑去找缚悉底回来的时候，佛陀告诉她没有必要。他打算和随行的比丘们及罗睺罗一起往河边找她的哥哥。他们找到缚悉底和卢培克时，已将近黄昏了。这兄弟俩正在尼连禅河中替九只水牛洗涤。两个小伙子一见到佛陀，便立刻跑到岸上来，把双手合成莲苞状，然后深深地鞠躬，礼敬佛陀。

Svasti  reflected  on  the  time,  just  two  weeks  before,  when  the  Buddha  came  to
Uruvela, his small village near Gaya, to invite him to become a monk. When the
Buddha arrived at his home, Svasti was out with his brother, Rupak, taking care
of the buffaloes. His two sisters, Bala, age sixteen, and Bhima, age twelve, were
there, and Bala recognized the Buddha right away. She began to run out to find
Svasti,  but  the  Buddha  told  her  it  wasn’t  necessary.  He  said  that  he  and  the
monks traveling with him, including Rahula, would walk to the river to find her
brother. It was late afternoon when they came upon Svasti and Rupak scrubbing
down  their  nine  buffaloes  in  the  Neranjara  River.  As  soon  as  they  saw  the
Buddha, the young men ran up the bank of the river, joined their palms to form a
lotus bud, and bowed deeply.



“你们长大了很多啊！”佛陀对他俩热情地笑着说。缚悉底并没有回答。看到佛陀那祥和的面孔，亲切又毫不吝啬的笑容，闪耀诱人的目光，缚悉底已被感动得热泪盈眶，不知说什么才好。佛陀穿着一件用很多碎布缝合成田状图案的衲衣。他依然是赤足而行，就像十年前在离这里不远的地方初次遇上缚悉底时一样。那段日子里，他们曾在河畔和菩提树荫下度过了很多时光。

“You’ve grown so much,” the Buddha said, smiling warmly at Svasti and his
brother. Svasti was speechless. Seeing the Buddha’s peaceful face, his warm and
generous  smile,  and  his  brilliant,  penetrating  eyes,  moved  him  to  tears.  The
Buddha  wore  a  saffron  robe  made  of  patches  sewn  together  in  the  pattern  of  a
rice field. He still walked barefoot as he had ten years before, when Svasti first
met him not far from this very spot. Ten years before they had spent hours sitting
together on the banks of the Neranjara and beneath the shade of the bodhi tree,
just ten minutes’ walk from the riverbank.

*十年前，佛陀初次遇上缚悉底。那段日子里，他们曾在河畔和菩提树荫下度过了很多时光，缚悉底更见证了佛陀觉悟的那一刻。*

缚悉底望望跟随着佛陀的二十位比丘，见他们个个都是赤着脚，穿着和佛陀一般颜色的衲衣。再看清楚一点，缚悉底才发觉佛陀的衲衣比其他比丘的长了一截，大约长一只手掌的长度。站在佛陀旁边的，是一个直望着他微笑而年纪又和他相若的沙弥。佛陀轻轻地在缚悉底和卢培克的头上拍拍，然后告诉他们，他是在回王舍城的路途中，特地前来探访他们的。他又表示很乐意等他们给水牛洗澡完毕后，和他们一起步行回到缚悉底的茅舍。

Svasti glanced at the twenty bhikkhus behind the Buddha and saw that they,
too,  were  barefoot  and  clad  in  patched  robes  of  the  same  color.  Looking  more closely, Svasti saw that the Buddha’s robe was a hand-length longer than those
of the others. Standing next to the Buddha was a novice about Svasti’s age who
looked at him directly and smiled. Buddha gently placed his hands on Svasti and
Rupak’s  heads  and  told  them  he  had  stopped  by  to  visit  on  his  way  back  to
Rajagaha. He said he would be happy to wait while Svasti and Rupak finished
bathing the buffaloes so they could all walk to Svasti’s thatched hut together.

在路上，佛陀介绍他的儿子罗睺罗给缚悉底和卢培克认识。原来刚才对他笑得灿烂的沙弥正是罗睺罗。他比缚悉底小三岁，但却和他一般高矮。虽然罗睺罗只是一个沙弥、一个初学者，但他穿的衣服却和其他比丘的无异。罗睺罗行在缚悉底和卢培克中间，把手里的钵交给卢培克，又把自己的双手温和地搭在两个新朋友的肩膀上。他从父亲的口中已听过很多关于缚悉底的事，所以对他已感到很熟络。这两兄弟也正陶醉在罗睺罗这股温暖的情怀里。

During the walk back, Buddha introduced Svasti and Rupak to his son Rahula,
the  young  novice  who  had  smiled  so  beautifully  at  Svasti.  Rahula  was  three
years  younger  than  Svasti,  but  they  were  the  same  height.  Rahula  was  a
samanera, a novice, but he dressed much the same as the older bhikkhus. Rahula
walked between Svasti and Rupak, handing his alms bowl to Rupak and placing
his arms lovingly around the shoulders of his two new friends. He had heard so
much  about  Svasti  and  his  family  from  his  father  that  he  felt  he  already  knew
them. The brothers basked in the warmth of Rahula’s love.

回到缚悉底的家中，佛陀便立刻邀请他加入僧团跟他修学佛法。十年前，缚悉底曾向佛陀表示他有意跟佛陀修学，而佛陀当时也曾答应会收他为徒。现在佛陀再回来，缚悉底已满二十一岁了。佛陀并没有忘记他的承诺。

As soon as they arrived at Svasti’s home, the Buddha invited him to join the
bhikkhu  community  and  study  the  Dharma  with  him.  Ten  years  earlier,  when
Svasti had first met the Buddha, he expressed his wish to study with him, and the
Buddha had agreed to accept Svasti as a disciple. Now that Svasti was twenty-
one, the Buddha had returned. He had not forgotten his promise.



卢培克拉着水牛回到牛主雷布尔庄主的住处。佛陀则坐在缚悉底屋外的一张小凳子上，比丘们都站在他的背后。泥土墙壁，茅草屋盖，缚悉底的房子实在容不下所有的人。芭娜对缚悉底说：“哥哥，请你跟佛陀去吧！卢培克比你当初放牛时还要健壮。我也已经可以打点房子的一切。你已经照顾我们十年多，现在该是我们照顾自己的时候了。”

Rupak  led  the  buffaloes  back  to  Mr.  Rambhul,  their  owner.  The  Buddha  sat
outside Svasti’s hut, on a small stool, while the bhikkhus stood behind him. With
earthen walls and a thatched roof, Svasti’s tiny home was not large enough for
everyone to come inside. Bala told Svasti, “Brother, please go with the Buddha.
Rupak  is  even  stronger  than  you  were  when  you  began  tending  the  buffaloes,
and I am quite capable of taking care of the house. You have looked after us for
ten years, and now we are ready to be on our own.”

媲摩坐在盛放雨水的大木桶旁边，望着她的姐姐，一言不发。缚悉底望望媲摩。她是一个非常可爱的女孩。缚悉底初遇佛陀的时候，芭娜只有六岁，卢培克三岁，媲摩则仍是个婴孩。卢培克在门外玩泥沙时，芭娜就在给全家烧饭。

Sitting next to the rainwater barrel, Bhima looked up at her big sister without
saying  a  word.  Svasti  looked  at  Bhima.  She  was  a  lovely  young  girl.  When
Svasti met the Buddha, Bala was six years old, Rupak three, and Bhima only an
infant. Bala cooked for the family while Rupak played in the sand.


他们父亲死后六个月，母亲也因分娩而去世。缚悉底虽然只有十一岁，却已经要当起一家之主。找到放水牛的工作后，缚悉底努力勤奋，足够使全家都能糊口。有时他还可以带一点水牛乳汁给小媲摩享用。

Six  months  following  their  father’s  death,  their  mother  passed  away  in
childbirth.  Just  eleven  years  old,  Svasti  became  the  head  of  the  household.  He
found a job tending water buffaloes, and because Svasti was a good worker, he
earned enough to feed his family. He was even able to bring buffalo milk home
for little Bhima.

媲摩明白缚悉底想知道她的感受，于是她微微地笑了。再踌躇一会儿，她轻声地说：“哥哥，你就跟佛陀去吧。”她转过头去，想把眼泪藏起来。她曾听过缚悉底无数次提起想跟佛陀修学的愿望，她实在是真心想让他去。但当这一刻将要来临时，她又按捺和掩饰不住内心的悲伤。

Realizing  that  Svasti  was  asking  her  about  her  feelings,  Bhima  smiled.  She
hesitated  a  moment  and  then  spoke  softly,  “Brother,  go  with  the  Buddha.”  She turned her face away to hide the tears. Bhima had heard Svasti mention his wish
to study  with Buddha  so many times and she truly wanted  him  to go, but  now
that the moment had arrived she could not hide her sadness.

这时，卢培克从村里回来，刚好听到媲摩说的话。他立刻知道分开的时刻终于来了。他望着缚悉底，然后说：“哥哥，请你随佛陀走吧！”这时，全屋寂静无声。卢培克将视线转向佛陀，又说：“我尊敬的大人，希望你允许我的哥哥追随你学习。我已够年长去照顾这个家了。”卢培克望向缚悉底，极力忍着泪水，再说：“不过，希望哥哥你请佛陀让你有空时回来探望我们。”佛陀站了起来，轻抚着媲摩的头发，然后说：“孩子们，先吃一点东西吧。明天早上，我会回来接缚悉底，然后一起去王舍城。今晚，我和比丘们会在菩提树下度宿一晚。”

Just then, Rupak returned from the village, and hearing Bhima’s words, “Go
with  the  Buddha,”  he  understood  that  the  time  had  come.  He  looked  at  Svasti
and  said,  “Yes,  brother,  please  go  with  the  Buddha,”  and  the  whole  family  fell silent.  Rupak  looked  at  the  Buddha  and  said,  “Venerable  Sir,  I  hope  you  will
permit  my  brother  to  study  with  you.  I  am  old  enough  to  care  for  our  family.”
Rupak turned to Svasti and, holding back his tears, said, “But brother, please ask
the Buddha if you can come back and visit us from time to time.”

The  Buddha stood  up and gently stroked Bhima’s hair.  “Children,  please eat
now.  Tomorrow  morning,  I  will  return  for  Svasti  so  we  can  walk  together  to
Rajagaha. The bhikkhus and I will rest beneath the bodhi tree tonight.”


佛陀行到木闸前，又回过头来对缚悉底说：“明天早上，你不用带任何东西。身上穿着的衣服已经足够。”

As  the  Buddha  reached  the  gate,  he  looked  back  at  Svasti  and  said,
“Tomorrow  morning,  you  do  not  need  to  bring  anything.  The  clothes  you  are
wearing are enough.”

那天晚上，他们兄弟姐妹四人谈到深夜。就像一个将要远行的父亲，缚悉底给他们做最后的叮嘱，要他们互相关怀，好好地照顾这个家。他轮流拥抱每一个弟妹。当小媲摩被哥哥紧抱在怀里时，她真的再也无法强忍眼泪了。她低声啜泣起来。不过她很快又抬起头来，深呼吸一下，然后望着哥哥微笑。她实在很不想令缚悉底难过。暗淡的油灯已足够令缚悉底看到她的笑容。他明白并感谢小妹妹的心意。

That night the four siblings stayed up late. Like a departing father, Svasti gave
them  his  last  advice  on  taking  care  of  each  other  and  the  household.  He
embraced  each  of  them  for  a  long  time.  Unable  to  hold  back  her  tears,  little
Bhima  sobbed  while  her  oldest  brother  held  her.  But  then  she  looked  up,
breathed deeply, and smiled at him. She didn’t want Svasti to feel sad. The oil
lamp  cast  a  dim  light,  but  it  was  enough  for  Svasti  to  see  her  smile,  and  he
appreciated it.

第二天清早，缚悉底的朋友善生也前来与他道别。她前一晚经过河畔时，是佛陀告诉她缚悉底将会出家加入僧团的。其实善生认识佛陀也是在他未证道之前。善生比缚悉底大两岁，是村长的女儿。她带了一小瓶草药送给缚悉底。但他们还没有谈上几句话，佛陀和他的弟子就到了。

Early  the  next  morning,  Sujata,  Svasti’s  friend,  came  to  say  goodbye.  The
evening  before,  she  had  seen  the  Buddha  when  she  was  on  her  way  to  the
riverbank,  and  he  told  her  that  Svasti  would  be  joining  the  order  of  monks.
Sujata,  the  daughter  of  the  village  head,  was  two  years  older  than  Svasti,  and
she, too, had met Gautama before he became the Buddha. Sujata gave Svasti a
small jar of herbal medicines to take with him. They spoke only briefly, and then
the Buddha and his disciples arrived.

缚悉底的弟弟妹妹已经一早起来准备送行。罗睺罗对他们一一轻声嘱咐，鼓励他们要坚强和互相照顾。他更承诺，每当他路经此地，必定会来优楼频螺探访他们。缚悉底一家人与善生跟着佛陀和比丘们一同行到河边。就在这里，他们全部合上掌来，与佛陀、诸比丘、罗睺罗及缚悉底道别。

Svasti’s brother and sisters were already awake to see their brother off. Rahula
spoke gently to each of them, encouraging them to be strong and to take care of
each other. He promised that whenever he was nearby, he would stop in Uruvela
to  visit  them.  Svasti’s  family  and  Sujata  walked  with  the  Buddha  and  the
bhikkhus to the riverbank, and there they joined their palms to say goodbye to
the Buddha, the monks, Rahula, and Svasti.

缚悉底心里感到既惶恐又喜悦。他紧张得胃里打结。这是他有生以来，第一次离开优楼频螺。佛陀说过，需要十天时间才可以到达王舍城。平常人是可以行得快一点的，但佛陀和他的比丘们行得比较慢，而且十分从容。当缚悉底的步伐放缓，他的心也跟着平静下来。他现在已全心全意地投入到了佛、法、僧之中，而这就是他要行的道路。他再转过头来，深情地看了他唯一熟悉的人和地最后一眼，善生和弟妹渐渐在他的视线中变成尘土般细小，融入了林树的影子里。

Svasti was overcome with both fear and joy. There was a knot in his stomach.
This was the first time he had ever left Uruvela. The Buddha said it would take
ten days to reach Rajagaha. Most people traveled more quickly, but the Buddha
and  his  bhikkhus  walked  slowly  and  with  great  ease.  As  Svasti’s  pace  slowed
down,  his  heart  quieted.  He  was  wholeheartedly  immersing  himself  in  the
Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, and this was his path. He turned around
for one last glimpse of the only land and people he knew, and he saw Sujata and his family as mere specks merging with the shadows of the forest trees.

对缚悉底来说，佛陀的步行就是为享受步行而行的。他似乎全不在乎是否能到达目的地。他的比丘们也是如此，没有一个人呈现些微的紧张和不耐烦，或希望尽快到达目的地。每个人的步伐都是那么缓稳平和。他们就像一起在写意地漫步，没有一点疲态。而每一天，他们都可以行上一段很长的路程。

It  seemed  to  Svasti  that  the  Buddha  walked  just  to  enjoy  the  walking,
unconcerned about arriving anywhere at all. So it was with all the bhikkhus. No
one  seemed  anxious  or  impatient  to  reach  their  destination.  Each  man’s  steps
were slow, balanced, and peaceful. It was as if they were taking a pleasant stroll
together. No one ever appeared tired, and yet they covered a good distance each
day.

每天早晨，他们都会到附近的村落中乞食。他们以佛陀为首，长列排行。缚悉底行在最后，紧跟在罗睺罗后面。他们步行时静悄庄严，每踏一步都专注地留意着每一下呼吸。他们会不时停下来接受村民的供养，使村民有机会把食物放进钵内。有些村民恭敬地跪在路旁，等候着供僧。当比丘们接受食物时，他们都默默地为村民诵经祝祷。

Each  morning  they  would  stop  in  the  nearest  village  to  beg  for  food.  They
walked along the streets in a single line with the Buddha at the head. Svasti came
last, just behind Rahula. They walked with quiet dignity, observing each breath
and each step. Once in a while, they would stop while villagers placed offerings
of food in their bowls. Some villagers knelt by the side of the road in respect. As
the bhikkhus received the food, they quietly recited prayers for the people.

乞食完毕，他们就会慢慢地离开村落，找一处树荫草坪坐下来进食。他们围成一个圈子坐下，然后小心地将食物分配到每一个钵中。罗睺罗到附近的溪涧盛一瓶清水回来，恭敬地拿到佛陀跟前。当佛陀双手合上形成莲花状后，罗睺罗便把水慢慢倒在佛陀的手上，让他清洗双手。他同样依次给每人洗净双手，最后才轮到缚悉底。因为缚悉底还没有他自己的钵，于是罗睺罗便把自己一半的食物放到一片大蕉叶上，分给他的好朋友。进食前，比丘们都合掌念诵，然后才默默地吃，留心注意着每一口食物。

When  they  finished  begging,  they  slowly  left  the  village  to  find  a  place
beneath some trees or in a grassy meadow where they could eat. They sat in a
circle  and  divided  the  food  equally,  careful  to  fill  anyone’s  bowl  that  was  still
empty.  Rahula  filled  a  jug  with  water  from  a  nearby  stream  and  respectfully
carried  it  to  the  Buddha.  After  the  Buddha  joined  his  palms  together  to  form
what  looked  like  a  lotus  flower,  Rahula  poured  the  water  over  the  Buddha’s
hands and rinsed them clean. He did the same for everyone else, coming last to
Svasti. As Svasti did not yet have a bowl, Rahula placed half of his own food on
a  fresh  banana  leaf  and  gave  it  to  his  new  friend.  Before  eating,  the  bhikkhus
joined  their  palms  and  chanted  together.  Then  they  ate  in  silence,  mindful  of
each bite.

进食后，一些比丘会修习行禅，另一些则修习坐禅，更有一些会午睡一会儿。等到日间最热的时候过后，他们才再次动身，继续旅程，直至入黑。他们一边行，一边留意有什么地方可以歇宿，而最理想的地方，当然就是那些不会受骚扰的森林了。每一个比丘都有自己的坐垫。他们多半是先跏趺静坐半个晚上，再铺好衲衣躺下来睡。每个比丘都有两件衲衣。一件是身穿的，另一件是用来避寒的。缚悉底像其他的比丘一般跏趺静坐，又学会了用树根作枕，睡在泥土地上。

When  they  finished,  some  bhikkhus  practiced  walking  meditation,  some  did
sitting meditation, and others took a short nap. When the hottest part of the day
had passed, they took to the road again, and they walked until it was nearly dark.
The best places to rest for the night were undisturbed forests, and they walked
until they found a good place. Each bhikkhu had his own cushion, and many sat
cross-legged  in  the  lotus  position  for  half  the  night  before  spreading  out  their
robes  and  going  to  sleep.  Each  bhikkhu  carried  two  robes,  the  one  he  was
wearing  and  another  to  use  as  protection  against  wind  and  cold.  Svasti  sat  in
meditation like the others and learned to sleep upon the earth using a tree root
for a pillow.

当缚悉底第二天早上醒来，已看到佛陀和很多比丘都在平静地禅坐。他们全都散发着安详和威严。太阳一出来，各人收拾好地上的衲衣，拾起钵，再准备开始新一天的旅程。

When  Svasti  awoke  the  next  morning,  he  saw  the  Buddha  and  many  of  the
bhikkhus  already  sitting  peacefully  in  meditation,  radiating  profound  calm  and
majesty. As soon as the sun rose over the horizon, each bhikkhu folded his extra robe, picked up his bowl, and began the day’s journey.

就这样日行夜息，他们终于行了十天才到达摩揭陀国的都城王舍城。这是缚悉底第一次见到城市。马车在布满房舍的街道上疾驰而过。到处都回响着喧闹和欢笑声。但比丘们的行列，就如他们在河边和田间行走时一样，依然是那么平静地缓步而行。几个城里住的人停了下来看他们。又有几个认得佛陀的，恭敬地作揖顶礼。比丘们继续他们平和的行列，直至抵达位于城外的竹林精舍。

Walking  by  day  and  resting  by  night,  it  was  ten  days  before  they  reached
Rajagaha,  the  capital  of  Magadha.  It  was  the  first  time  Svasti  had  seen  a  city.
Horse  carts  pressed  through  streets  lined  with  crowded  dwellings;  shouts  and
laughter  echoed  everywhere.  But  the  silent  procession  of  the  bhikkhus
continued,  as  peacefully  as  when  they  strolled  along  the  quiet  riverbanks  or
between  country  rice  fields.  A  few  of  the  city  dwellers  paused  to  watch  them,
and  a  few,  recognizing  the  Buddha,  bowed  deeply  to  show  their  respect.  The
bhikkhus continued their calm procession until they reached the Bamboo Forest
Monastery, just beyond the city.

佛陀回来的消息很快传遍寺院。不到几分钟，近四百个比丘已齐集欢迎他回来。佛陀没有说太多，只是问问他们的近况和禅定的修习情形。他交托舍利弗照顾缚悉底，罗睺罗也是依止舍利弗的。舍利弗是寺院里沙弥的主导师，负责看管超过五十个年轻的初学者。他们全部都是参加僧团未超过三年的。寺院的常住则是一个名叫憍陈如的比丘。

News spread quickly throughout the monastery that the Buddha had returned,
and  within  moments,  nearly  four  hundred  bhikkhus  gathered  to  welcome  him
back. The Buddha did not say much but asked about everyone’s well-being and
meditation  practice.  He  entrusted  Svasti  to  Sariputta,  who  was  also  Rahula’s
spiritual  instructor.  Sariputta  was  the  novice  master  of  Bamboo  Forest
Monastery  and  watched  over  the  studies  of  nearly  fifty  young  monks,  all  of
whom  had  been  in  the  community  for  less  than  three  years.  The  abbot  of  the
monastery was a monk named Kondanna.

罗睺罗被安排指导缚悉底有关寺院的生活规仪，包括行住坐卧，与别人交往，修习行禅、坐禅、细观呼吸等。他又要教缚悉底怎样穿衲衣、乞食、诵经和清洗他的钵。连续三天，为了好好学会这些，缚悉底没有离开过罗睺罗身边半步。罗睺罗也全心全意地教导缚悉底。不过，缚悉底知道自己如要将这一切做得自然自在，非要多年的磨炼不可。经过这一番基本指引后，缚悉底被舍利弗邀请到他的房子里，讲解有关比丘的戒条。

Rahula was asked to introduce Svasti to the ways of monastery life—how to
walk, sit, stand, greet others, do walking and sitting meditation, and observe his
breathing.  He  also  showed  Svasti  how  to  wear  the  monk’s  robe,  beg  for  food,
recite  prayers,  and  wash  his  bowl.  For  three  continuous  days,  Svasti  did  not
leave  Rahula’s  side,  so  that  he  could  learn  these  things  well.  Rahula  put  his
whole  heart  into  instructing  Svasti,  yet  Svasti  knew  it  would  take  years  of
practicing  before  he  would  be  able  to  do  these  things  in  a  relaxed  and  natural
way.  After  this  basic  instruction,  Sariputta  invited  Svasti  into  his  hut  and
explained the precepts of a bhikkhu.

一个比丘离开家庭，是为着以佛陀为师，以佛法为开悟之道，以僧团为修行上的支援。一个比丘的生活简单纯朴。乞食除能助长谦卑之外，更成为与外界接触的机会，借此使一般人体会到佛陀对爱心和体恤的教导。

A  bhikkhu  was  one  who  left  his  family  in  order  to  follow  the  Buddha  as  a
teacher, the Dharma as the path which leads to awakening, and the Sangha as the
community  that  supports  one  along  the  path.  A  bhikkhu’s  life  was  simple  and
humble. Begging for food helped foster humility and was also a means to be in
contact with others and help them see the Way of Love and Understanding which
the Buddha taught.

十年前，在菩提树下，缚悉底和他的朋友曾听过佛陀解释说，开悟之道就是爱与宽容之道。所以他现在很容易便领悟到舍利弗所说的。虽然舍利弗的外貌严肃，但他的目光和笑容都散发着无限的温暖和慈悲。他告诉缚悉底将会举行一个受戒仪式，来正式接受他加入僧团。

他也同时教缚悉底背诵一些在仪式上要说的字句。

Ten years earlier beneath the bodhi tree, Svasti and his friends had listened to
the  Buddha  speak  about  the  path  of  awakening  as  the  path  of  love  and
understanding, so it was easy for him to grasp all that Sariputta told him. Though Sariputta’s face appeared serious, his eyes and smile radiated great warmth andcompassion. He told Svasti that there would be a precepts ceremony to formally
accept him into the community of bhikkhus, and he taught Svasti the words he
would need to recite.



舍利弗是戒仪的主持。有二十多个比丘参加这个仪式。看到佛陀和罗睺罗在旁观礼，缚悉底倍添欢喜。舍利弗默念一首偈语后，便将缚悉底头上几撮头发剃下。跟着，他把剃刀交给罗睺罗去把缚悉底剩下的头发剃掉。舍利弗给缚悉底三件僧衣、一只乞钵和一个滤水器。因为经过了罗睺罗的指导，缚悉底很轻易便将衲衣穿上。跟着，他向佛陀及在场众比丘顶礼，以表示他深切的谢意。

Sariputta  himself  presided  over  the  precepts  ceremony.  About  twenty
bhikkhus  attended.  The  Buddha  and  Rahula  were  there,  adding  to  Svasti’s
happiness. Sariputta silently recited a gatha, and then shaved off several locks of
Svasti’s  hair.  He  then  gave  the  razor  to  Rahula,  who  completed  the  task  of
shaving  Svasti’s  head.  Sariputta  gave  Svasti  three  robes,  a  bowl,  and  a  water
filter.  Because  he  had  already  been  taught  by  Rahula  how  to  wear  the  robe,
Svasti  put  it  on  without  difficulty.  He  bowed  before  the  Buddha  and  the  other
bhikkhus present to express his deep gratitude.



将近午间时分，缚悉底第一次正式以比丘的身份练习行乞。竹林精舍的全部比丘分成数个小队，分别步往王舍城。缚悉底跟着舍利弗带领的一队。行出寺院不到数步，他就提醒自己，乞食也是修行的一种方法。他集中观察着自己的呼吸，静心留意前行的每一步。罗睺罗行在他的后面。虽然缚悉底现在已是一个比丘，但他很明白自己的经验比罗睺罗少得多。他真诚坚决地发心要好好地栽培自己内在的谦卑和美德。

Later that morning, Svasti practiced begging for the first time as an ordained
bhikkhu.  The  monks  of  Bamboo  Forest  Monastery  walked  into  Rajagaha  in
several  small  groups,  and  Svasti  was  part  of  the  group  led  by  Sariputta.  After
taking  just  a  few  steps  out  of  the  monastery,  Svasti  reminded  himself  that
begging was a vehicle to practice the Way. He observed his breathing and took
each  step  quietly  and  in  mindfulness.  Rahula  walked  behind  him.  Although  he
was now a bhikkhu, Svasti knew that he had considerably less experience than
Rahula.  He  resolved  with  all  his  heart  to  nurture  humility  and  virtue  within
himself.
